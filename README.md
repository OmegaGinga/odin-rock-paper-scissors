Rock, paper, scissors odin project game

Hello! I've made a game about Rock, Paper and Scissors with the instructions of Odin Project.
This was a very fun project and I put my effort in it to make it the most well constructed project since i started to learn with Odin Project.
I really appreciate the work of Odin Project and i will continue learning with them.

This are some features of the game:

* The game takes the choice of the player.
* Then the code choose a option for the computer.
* It will be repeating 5 times.
* The greatest of the score between the player and the computer will win.
